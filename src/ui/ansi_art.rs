//! # ANSI Art Module
//!
//! This module contains ASCII art with ANSI color codes for various game scenes and UI elements.
//! These art assets are used throughout the game to enhance the visual experience of the
//! text-based interface.
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//!
//! - Uses ANSI escape sequences for colors (\x1B[XXm)
//! - Contains ASCII art for all major game areas and scenes
//! - Art is stored as string constants for easy inclusion in the UI

/// Title screen banner (ASCII art with ANSI colors) to display on game start.
/// 
/// This banner is shown when the game first launches, providing a colorful
/// welcome screen with the game title and basic menu options.
